## M322

This website was part of a Modul we had about full stack development. Obviously this code base isn't without it's flaws, but the point of this project was to get familiar with CRUD operations and how to build websites.
In order to run this app locally you need to install XAMPP for the PHP interpreter and Mysql server. After that you just run the app and there you have it.
